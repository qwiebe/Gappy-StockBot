**Disclaimer #1**: This code is currently incomplete and does not function as it should.  I've take a bit of a hiatus from this project for the time-being.  I'd say it's about 97.3% complete in regards to infrastructure, but the core trading-logic is at about 67.2%.

**Disclaimer #2**: the results of this program are not indicative of any financial prowess and should not be used as professional advice

I, Quinton Wiebe, the creator of this program absolve myself of all responsibility in the case of lost funds.  In the case of increased funds, I take full responsibility
